> Project: Shell scripts and training challenges for 1337 students

---

## Description

This repository contains Bash/Shell scripts and training exercises intended for 1337 students. The goal is to provide reusable resources, examples, and practice challenges to improve your Shell skills.

## Images (Optimized for PC)

To make your README look clean on desktop screens (PC), use the following image recommendations:

* **Banner**: Width between `1000px` and `1280px`, height between `300px` and `400px`.
* **Screenshots / Thumbnails**: Around `800px` width.

### How to Add Images With Size Control

Place your images inside the `assets/` folder, then insert them in the README using one of these methods:

**1) HTML tag (recommended — allows custom width):**

```html
<!-- Banner at 1000px width -->
<img src="assets/1337-banner.png" alt="1337 Banner" width="1000">

<!-- Screenshot at 800px width -->
<img src="assets/screenshot-1.png" alt="Screenshot" width="800">
```

**2) Standard Markdown (does NOT allow size control):**

```markdown
![1337 Banner](assets/1337-banner.png)
```

If using Markdown and you want a smaller size, resize the image before uploading.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/simo-SM/shellpool1337.git
cd shellpool1337
```

## Usage

* All Bash scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory.
* Read the comments inside each script to understand its purpose.

Example of running a script:

```bash
bash scripts/example.sh
```

* Keep the banner under ~500KB if possible.
* Place a clean banner at the top of the README (1000px width) for a professional PC look.
